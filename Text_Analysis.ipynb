    "## Motivation: Text Analysis on University of Maryland Patents\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we were able to use the [Patentsview API](https://www.patentsview.org/api/query-language.html) to pull data from patents awarded to inventors at University of Maryland, including the abstract from each of the patents. Suppose we wanted to know what types of patents were awarded to UMD. We can look at the information from the abstracts and read through them, but this would take a very long time since there are almost 1,300 abstracts. Instead, we can use **text analysis** to help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as-is, the text from abstracts can be difficult to analyze. We aren't able to use traditional statistical techniques without some heavy data manipulation, because the text is essentially a categorical variable with unique values for each patent. We need to basically break it apart and clean the data before we apply our data analysis techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the process of cleaning and processing the text data to prepare it for **topic modeling**, which is the process of automatically assigning topics to individual **documents** (in this case, an individual document is an abstract from a patent). We will use a technique called **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** as our topic modeling technique, and try to determine what sorts of patents were awarded to University of Maryland."

    "## Introduction to Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text analysis** is used to extract useful information from or summarize a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g. surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information Retrieval**: Find relevant information in a large database, such as a systematic literature review, that would be very time-consuming for humans to do manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and Text Categorization**: Summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases, using methods like topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate documents from one language to another. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus is the set of all text documents used in your analysis; for example, your corpus of text may include hundreds of abstracts from patent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is separated into meaningful terms or phrases. In English this is easy to do for individual words, as they are separated by whitespace; however, it can get more complicated to  automate determining which groups of words constitute meaningful phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is normalizing text by reducing all forms or conjugations of a word to the word's most basic form. In English, this can mean making a rule of removing the suffixes \"ed\" or \"ing\" from the end of all words, but it gets more complex. For example, \"to go\" is irregular, so you need to tell the algorithm that \"went\" and \"goes\" stem from a common lemma, and should be considered alternate forms of the word \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF**: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature engineering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of words that often appear together are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in one topic should be related and make sense (e.g. boat, ship, captain). Individual documents can fall under one topic or multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning but occur very frequently, like prepositions, articles and common nouns. For example, every document (in English) will probably contain the words \"and\" and \"the\" many times. You will often remove them as part of preprocessing using a list of stop words.\n"

    "A final step in cleaning and processing our text data is **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**. TF-IDF is based on the idea that the words (or terms) that are most related to a certain topic will occur frequently in documents on that topic, and infrequently in unrelated documents.  TF-IDF re-weights words so that we emphasize words that are unique to a document and suppress words that are common throughout the corpus by inversely weighting terms based on their frequency within the document and across the corpus.\n",

    "In order to produce labels we need to first have examples our algorithm can learn from, a \"training set.\" In the context of text analysis, developing a training set can be very expensive, as it can require a large amount of human labor or linguistic expertise. **Document classification** is an example of supervised learning in which want to characterize our documents based on their contents (*X*). A common example of document classification is spam e-mail detection. Another example of supervised learning in text analysis is *sentiment analysis*, where *X* is our documents and *Y* is the state of the author. This \"state\" is dependent on the question you're trying to answer, and can range from the author being happy or unhappy with a product to the author being politically conservative or liberal. Another example is *part-of-speech tagging* where *X* are individual words and *Y* is the part-of-speech. "
